# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Analysis on Kickstarter data for discovering trends

### Upon analysis of data of Kickstarter campaigns, we sought to uncover trends regarding: when is the best time to launch a campaign, what category of campaigns are the most successful, and in respect to theater campaigns, how much was the goal vs pledged.

The above graph represents how successful Kickstarter campaigns were, in respect to the month they were launched. As we can see, May has the highest number of successful campaigns. December has the lowest number, so if one was prospectively launching a campaign, December and September should be avoided.

The above graph represents categories of the Kickstarter campaigns, globally. We can see that Theater was the most popular category for campaigns, followed by Music. Theater campaigns are also relatively successful and have a low chance of being canceled.

The above graph represents Goal vs. Pledged Amounts for Theater Kickstarter campaigns in Great Britain. This data shows that around £4,000 is the average for the goal, while the average for pledged is less than £2,000.

Based on these results, it can be recommended that to increase your chances of a successful theater campaign, it should be launched in February, May, or June, with a goal of less than £4,000.
